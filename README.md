# SpeechRecognition.github.io

Disclaimer: This is not a super advanced AI like googles or Siri, it's just me literally messing around with some code.

I used google chrome with a few new apis that are available for us to mess around with in javascript, one of them being the speech synthesis api. 

Copy and paste this url in a browser http://bit.ly/3cL9Sbu to see what this SpeechRecognition can do.

P.S. This AI is'nt a friendly one.
